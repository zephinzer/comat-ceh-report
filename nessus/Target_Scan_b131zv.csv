like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP, it
will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will
continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection.

The purpose of this service was to mostly test the TCP/IP protocol
by itself, to make sure that all the packets were arriving at their
destination unaltered. It is unused these days, so it is suggested
you disable it, as an attacker may use it to set up an attack against
this host, or against a third-party host using this host as a relay.

An easy attack is 'ping-pong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
two machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
each other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.","- Under Unix systems, comment out the 'chargen' line in /etc/inetd.conf
  and restart the inetd process

- Under Windows systems, set the following registry keys to 0 :
  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SimpTCP\Parameters\EnableTcpChargen

vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the

    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server. (VulnDB 144759)","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.2i or later.

Note that the GOST ciphersuites vulnerability (VulnDB 144759) is not
yet fixed by the vendor in an official release; however, a patch for

OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2i. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)
